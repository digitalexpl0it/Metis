# Changelog

All notable changes to Metis are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2026-06-21]

### Added

- **Settings app (`metis-settings`)** — a standalone GTK4 application with a
  sidebar/stack layout and four pages: **Appearance** (theme mode, accent/
  secondary/semantic color pickers, bar opacity + blur + blur radius),
  **Weather** (units, auto-detect/IP-geolocation toggles, Open-Meteo location
  search, saved-location management), **Network** (Wi-Fi scan/connect/forget +
  radio toggle, and per-NIC Ethernet IPv4 DHCP/static editors via `nmcli`), and
  **Calendars** (CalDAV + Microsoft 365 account management). Pages write the
  shared `~/.config/metis/*.json` files; the running shell picks changes up via
  its file watchers and new `reload-theme`/`reload-weather`/`reload-calendars`
  runtime commands. Launch it from the bar's launcher icon, the wired-only
  network popover's "Network Settings…" button, or `metis-cmd settings [page]`
  (`--page {appearance|weather|network|calendars}` preselects a page).
- **Shared `metis-config` crate** — all pure (serde + filesystem, no GTK)
  configuration types and the theme token model / stylesheet builder moved into a
  new workspace crate so both the shell and the settings app consume one source
  of truth. Added `save_bar_config`/`save_weather_config`/`save_theme_tokens`
  helpers and exported the per-file path getters.
- **Shared `metis-secrets` crate** — a thin `oo7` (freedesktop Secret Service)
  wrapper so both apps read/write the same keyring items for CalDAV passwords and
  Microsoft 365 refresh tokens.
- **Server-side window decorations** — the compositor now advertises
  `zxdg_decoration_manager_v1` and forces server-side mode on every toplevel, so
  GTK omits its client-side headerbar. Each tiled app window gets a compositor-
  drawn titlebar (with the window title rendered via `fontdue`), a thin border,
  and macOS-style close / minimize / maximize buttons. Clicking the buttons maps
  to the existing close/minimize/maximize actions and dragging the titlebar moves
  the window; the old undrawn 44 px grid "tile header" inset is replaced by this
  real chrome.

## [2026-06-20]

### Added

- **Live theme reload** — editing `~/.config/metis/themes/dark.json` or
  `light.json` now re-applies the active theme within ~250 ms (a GFileMonitor on
  the themes directory re-runs `init_theme()`), mirroring the existing live
  `bar.json` reload. No restart needed to tweak colors.
- **Freedesktop notifications** — Metis now runs an `org.freedesktop.Notifications`
  D-Bus daemon (zbus, on a background thread) so any desktop app's notifications
  surface in the in-bar notification popup. The bus name is acquired with the
  replace flag, so Metis takes over from a previously running daemon (dunst/mako).
  Urgency hints map to notification kinds (low→info, normal→alert, critical→error).
- **Themeable palette** — the stylesheet is now token-driven instead of hardcoded.
  Themes gain a secondary accent (`accent[1]`), a `semantic` status palette
  (`error`/`warning`/`success`/`info`/`payment`), and `text_on_accent`. ~27 fixed
  cyan literals, the notification kind colors, on-accent text, and the floating
  card shadows now derive from theme tokens, so accent/secondary/semantic/shadow
  changes flow through the whole bar UI. New token fields use serde defaults, so
  existing theme files keep working.
- **Bar transparency + backdrop blur** — `bar.json` `opacity` makes the bar
  see-through, and a new compositor Gaussian **backdrop blur** frosts the
  wallpaper behind the bar. Controlled by `blur` (on/off) and a new `blur_radius`
  (pixels, 1–64). The compositor samples the wallpaper under the bar through a
  custom GLES shader and re-reads the blur fields from `bar.json` live (~1s), so
  a future Settings app only needs to write the file. (Blur targets the bar's
  exclusive-zone rectangle; rounded-corner masking is a future refinement.)

## [2026-06-19]

### Added

- **Weather widget** — a condition icon + temperature in the bar opens a popover
  with current conditions (temp, label, daily high/low), a short hourly forecast
  strip, any additional saved locations, and an Open-Meteo attribution footer.
  Data is fetched (keyless) from Open-Meteo on a background thread and refreshed
  every 15 minutes (and on popover open). Location auto-detects via IP
  geolocation (city-level, keyless ipwho.is) with an offline system-timezone
  fallback; temperature unit auto-resolves (US-style regions → °F, otherwise °C).
  A `weather.json` config (unit, auto-detect, pinned locations) is read when
  present (incl. an `ip_geolocation` toggle) — the upcoming Settings app will
  manage it. Auto-detection prefers IP geolocation and falls back to the offline
  `zoneinfo` tables, caches the result, applies a 12s timeout to all HTTP so a
  stalled host can't hang the widget, logs failures, and retries every 30s after
  a failed fetch instead of waiting the full refresh window.
- **Wi-Fi popover** — the bar network icon is now interactive: clicking it opens a
  popover with a read-only Ethernet status row, a scrollable list of nearby Wi-Fi
  networks (signal strength, lock for secured, check for the active one), a Wi-Fi
  radio toggle, and a refresh/rescan button. Secured networks reveal an inline
  password entry; a spinner shows on the row while connecting. Backed by `nmcli`
  through a background command queue mirroring the audio widget.
- **Startup splash** — a centered overlay shows the Metis logo on a translucent card
  with a loading progress bar at session start. The bar crawls while the shell comes
  up, ramps to 100% once it's ready (with a minimum on-screen time and a hard timeout
  fallback), then fades out. The logo is embedded in the binary. Like the timer HUD,
  the layer surface is kept mapped and parked off-screen rather than destroyed, so
  closing it never disconnects the shell.
- **Startup chime** — an embedded `startup.mp3` plays once alongside the splash via
  GTK's media backend (best-effort; degrades silently if no media backend is present).
- **Launcher icon** — the Metis brand icon is pinned to the far-leading edge of the
  bar as a button (the seed of the upcoming app-menu launcher). The icon asset is
  embedded in the binary, so it renders regardless of the working directory.
- **Clock popover suite** — the bar clock now opens a tabbed popover with pill-style
  tabs: Calendar, World Clocks, Stopwatch, Timer, and Alarms.
  - **World Clocks** — inline searchable timezone picker (entry + list, no nested
    dropdown), up to three additional zones listed under the calendar.
  - **Stopwatch** — full-size view with lap times in a scrollable list.
  - **Timer** — a movable, always-on-top layer-shell HUD with pause/close controls
    that can be dragged anywhere on screen but never over the edge bar.
  - **Alarms** — a segmented sound selector (replaces the dropdown) for choosing the
    alarm tone.
- **Notification popup** improvements:
  - "Clear all" button (bottom-right) that clears every notification.
  - Identical notifications are grouped into one card with a count badge.
  - Per-kind icons (error, alarm/notification, success, information, payment),
    tinted to match the notification's accent color.
  - Clearing animates each card sliding out to the left.
  - Vertical scrollbar when the list overflows.
  - Demo feed for testing, enabled with `METIS_DEMO_NOTIFICATIONS=1`.
- **In-bar notification routing** — timer/alarm/reminder alerts are pushed into the
  bar's notification popup via a runtime notification store instead of spawning an
  external `notify-send` process.

### Changed

- Existing `bar.json` layouts are migrated to include the new `weather` widget
  ahead of the system/clock cluster.
- Dropped two redundant `nmcli` calls per network poll (the legacy
  `network_label`/`network_connected` snapshot fields the Wi-Fi popover replaced).
- Timer-finished alerts no longer tear down the HUD's layer surface; the HUD is parked
  off-screen instead, keeping the surface mapped for the session.
- Notification cards are wider with proper internal padding so text no longer sits at
  the card edge.
- **Wallpaper decoding** is now fully off the compositor's main thread and debounced:
  - `invalidate()` detaches the in-flight decode instead of joining it on the main
    loop, fixing a multi-second freeze on every window resize.
  - Resizes (maximize/restore) are debounced into a single decode and driven from the
    compositor heartbeat, so a re-decoded wallpaper appears promptly instead of after
    the next unrelated damage event (previously a 10–20s delay on maximize).
  - The full-resolution source image is cached in memory, so resizing only re-scales
    instead of re-reading and re-decoding the JPEG from disk.
- **Dev builds compile dependencies optimized** (`[profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3`).
  The `image` crate was running unoptimized, making wallpaper decode/resize take
  several seconds; this brings it down to tens of milliseconds while keeping our own
  crates fast to compile.

### Fixed

- Silenced the benign `surface missing from known popups` ERROR from Smithay
  (GTK tears down short-lived entry sub-popups before their grab resolves) with a
  targeted log filter that keeps all other xdg-shell diagnostics.
- **Blank screen on startup from the chime** — the GStreamer media backend aborts
  (`gtk_gst_media_file_open: code should not be reached`) when a `MediaFile` is built
  from an input stream, which killed the shell before the bar appeared. The embedded
  chime is now materialized to a temp file and opened via `MediaFile::for_filename`.
- **Square edge-bar shadow** — the rounded pill's drop shadow was clipped square at
  the layer surface's rectangular edge. The surface now reserves a small padding
  around the pill (`BAR_SHADOW_PAD`) with the pill inset inside it, and the shadow was
  tightened so it renders fully and follows the bar's rounded corners.
- **Edge bar crash on timer completion** — removing the HUD's tooltips and keeping its
  layer surface mapped eliminates the `Broken pipe` Wayland protocol error that
  disconnected the shell when a timer ended.
- **Clock popover freeze / `surface missing from known popups`** — keyboard/text input
  in the popover now works via proper `xdg_popup` grabs; dropdowns no longer render
  behind the popover.
- **Notification popup layout overflow** — bounded the wrapping title/message labels
  (`max_width_chars`) and pinned the per-kind icon to a fixed size, fixing the GTK
  `gtk_widget_measure`/`size_allocate` overflow (huge/`INT_MIN` widths) introduced with
  the notification icons.
- **Wallpaper/briefing could not be re-enabled in `--session`** — `METIS_NO_WALLPAPER=`
  / `METIS_NO_BRIEFING=` (explicit empty) now correctly enable wallpaper and briefing.
  `run-metis.sh` no longer collapses an empty value back to `1` (`${VAR:-1}`), and the
  compositor/shell now treat the flags as disabled only when set to a *non-empty* value
  (previously any set value, including empty, counted as disabled).
